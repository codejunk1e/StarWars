# Starwars 🚀
[ 🚧 Work in progress 👷‍♀️⛏👷🔧️👷🔧 🚧 \]

A simple android app to test out a few concepts. Most of the things already in the app where inspired by this [website](https://starwars-visualguide.com/) and data is drawn from the [star wars API](https://swapi.dev/) formerly [here](https://github.com/phalt/swapi) but no longer maintained.
